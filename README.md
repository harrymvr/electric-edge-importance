# Electrical measures of importance for network edges
This is a presentation on three electrical measures of importance for edges in a graph. Part of the 
goal of this talk is to shed some light on the almost arcane formulas that are involved in the computation of 
these measures, and derive them from the basic laws of physics. You can view the slides by following this link:
